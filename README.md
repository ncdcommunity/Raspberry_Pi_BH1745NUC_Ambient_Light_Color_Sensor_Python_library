# BH1745NUC

ROHM Semiconductorâ€™s BH1745NUC is a 16-bit I2C digital color sensor that detects RGB (Red, Green, Blue) components and converts them into digital values. High sensitivity, wide detection range (0.005 to 40k lx), and excellent IR cut characteristics make it easy to accurately obtain the color temperature and brightness of ambient light.This Device is available from www.ncd.io
